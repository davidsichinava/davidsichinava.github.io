I am a human geographer with ten years of experience doing academic and applied social research in post-Soviet Eurasia. My research focuses on the socio-spatial and temporal aspects of inequality, politics of urban development, and conflict-induced displacement. My contributions have appeared in media outlets such as the Washington Post and Eurasianet, while my academic works have been published as a journal article in Eurasian Geography and Politics and chapters in edited volumes published by Routledge and University of Toronto Press.

Currently, I serve as a Research Director at CRRC-Georgia, a leading Georgian think tank focused on policy issues in the South Caucasus. I am also an Assistant Professor of Human Geography at Tbilisi State University
